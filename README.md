# What is this project?

**slf4php** is **similar** to the [slf4j](http://www.slf4j.org/) (The Simple Logging Facade for Java) project.

**slf4php** is not a logging implementation! **This is** more like **an abstraction layer** on the top of existing logging frameworks like [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) - just like [slf4j](http://www.slf4j.org/)

If you are not adding (configuring) any logging implementation no problem! **slf4php** will default itself to the "no operation" mechanism. In terms of using the facade in your code nothing will change. And you can configure the logging any time later!

# Supported logging implementations

This first 1.0 version supports [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) logging implementation out of the box by providing `MonologProxyAppender` class.

Probably there will be more in upcoming versions.

# The concept - in a nut shell

We have the following key entities:

   * **Appenders**  
     You might consider an `Appender` as an output channel. Writes something out to somewhere somehow... (file, database, e-mail, etc.)  
This is the point where an existing logging framework comes to the picture! This project doesn't have own `Appender` implementations. Rather doing that it just gives you "connectors" (typically following the proxy / adapter design patterns) to let you use your favorite logging framework(s).  

   * **Loggers**  
In your code you need a `Logger` instance to log messages. You can invoke the appropriate log method (info(), debug(), warning(), etc.) on it - as defined by the `LoggerInterface` in [PSR/log](https://github.com/php-fig/log)  
Loggers have **log level**. AND... They **have one or more Appenders** behind them! When you log something with your Logger instance this is routed to all the Appenders behind the Logger. So as a result your log message is written to a file, database or sent via e-mail. OR all together!  

   * **LoggerFactory**  
We have a `LoggerFactory`. You ask for the `Logger` instance from the factory - by providing the fully qualified class name of your class you want to do logging from. You get back a `Logger` instance - matching for the logging configuration you have provided to the `LoggerFactory` beforehand.

# And: the configuration

We want to be able to easily configure all the above! To achieve this the best way is having a simple (as possible) **configuration file**.

Take a quick look on the following JSON config and you will immediatelly understand the concept:

```json
{
	"appenders" : [
		{
			"name" : "logFile",
			"builderClass" : "swf\\slf4php\\config\\builder\\monolog\\MonologProxyAppenderBuilder",
			"handlers" : [
				{
					"builderClass" : "swf\\slf4php\\config\\builder\\monolog\\MonologStreamHandlerBuilder",
					"stream" : "${LOG_DIR}/application.log",
					"formatter": {
						"builderClass" : "swf\\slf4php\\config\\builder\\monolog\\MonologLineFormatterBuilder",
						"format" : "[%datetime%] %extra.loggerName%.%level_name%: %message% %context% %extra%\n\n"
					}
				}
			]
		},
		{
			"name" : "console",
			"builderClass" : "swf\\slf4php\\config\\builder\\monolog\\MonologProxyAppenderBuilder",
			"handlers" : [
				{
					"builderClass" : "swf\\slf4php\\config\\builder\\monolog\\MonologStreamHandlerBuilder",
					"stream" : "php://stdout",
					"formatter": {
						"builderClass" : "swf\\slf4php\\config\\builder\\monolog\\MonologLineFormatterBuilder",
						"format" : "[%datetime%] %extra.loggerName%.%level_name%: %message% %context% %extra%\n\n"
					}
				}
			]
		}
	],

	"loggers" : [
		{
			"name" : "your.namespace.A",
			"level" : "DEBUG",
			"appenders" : ["logFile", "console"]
		},
		{
			"name" : "your.namespace.B",
			"level" : "INFO",
			"appenders" : "logFile"
		},
		{
			"level" : "WARNING",
			"appenders" : "logFile"
		}
	]
}
```

With the above simple config we have:
   * Created two Appenders: a log file and a console. Using [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) `StreamHandler`
   * Created a DEBUG level Logger for "your.namespace.A" which is using both the log file Appender and the console Appender
   * Created an INFO level Logger for "your.namespace.B" which is using the log file Appender only
   * And created a WARNING level Logger using the log file Appender too. AND... You can notice that this one has no namespace definition... Which means that this is the *default* logger setup

# Basic usage  
  
Assuming you have the above config saved in file named **log.config.json** you can configure the `LoggerFactory` like this:
  
```php
<?php
use swf\slf4php\LoggerFactory;
use swf\slf4php\config\builder\LogConfigBuilder;
use swf\util\JsonUtil;

....

// you might use variables in the json file (unix like style) and we can pass an array to the json parsing mechanism
// to let it resolve the vars
$envVars = [
	'LOG_DIR' => '/var/log'
];
$loggerConfig = LogConfigBuilder::create()->initFromJson(JsonUtil::getJsonObjects("log.config.json"), $envVars)->build();
// and now we can init the factory
LoggerFactory::init($loggerConfig);
```
  
Once you have configured the `LoggerFactory` you can start get `Logger` instances from the factory like this:

```php
$myLogger = LoggerFactory::getLogger(YourClass::class);   // the parameter is the fully qualified class name of YourClass
$myLogger->info("This is a log message", []);
```

As you might have already figured this out when you get a Logger from the factory you will get back the Logger which is matching the configuration!

In this case:
```php
$logger = LoggerFactory::getLogger('\your\namespace\A\MyClass');
```
you will get back a DEBUG level Logger instance with the logFile and the console Appenders behind this.

While in this case:
```php
$logger = LoggerFactory::getLogger('JustAClass');
```
it will be the *default* logger which is matching so you will get back a WARNING level Logger instance with the logFile Appender behind this.


# Dumping out variables in log messages

One of the ideas I like most in the [slf4j](http://www.slf4j.org/) Java framework is this part.

Imagine we have complex objects. In DEBUG level we often want to dump those objects into log streams. But as soon as we change the log level to something more restrictive if we still keep dumping those objects into Strings (the log message) and then just throw them away because of the log level... Well this is a waste of CPU power and additional job to the Garbage Collector... So we shouldn't do that!

Here is a **bad example**:

```php
// this might be a huge object:
$jsonObj = json_decode($jsonString);
...
// and this is a bad idea...:
$myLogger->debug("Parsed json object is: " . print_r($jsonObj, true), []);
```

Why is it a bad idea to do this this way? Because the String parameter is constructed anyways - using up memory and CPU power. And if the logLevel is not DEBUG then it was for nothing...

[slf4j](http://www.slf4j.org/) has an elegant solution for this - it is using "varargs" in Java. This means that a method can get any number of additional parameters. And actually PHP also supports this so we can use it here as well!

Keeping the example above here is the *recommended* way to do this:

```php
// this might be a huge object:
$jsonObj = json_decode($jsonString);
...
// do it this way instead:
$myLogger->debug("Parsed json object is: {}", [], $jsonObj);
```

You can define placeholders in you log message with adding `{}` into the log message. And then you simply pass over the variables to the log method invocation.

You can use as many placeholders as you would like to. The number of variables you pass to the method should match with the number of placeholders you used in the message! (If you pass less or more variables it is not a tragedy of course but your log message can look "strange" then)

**IMPORTANT!** You shouldn't do ANY transformations on the objects you pass over! You should pass over the variable as it is and leave it up to **slf4php** to do the string transformation - if needed!

DO NOT DO THIS:

```php
$jsonObj = json_decode($jsonString);
...
// you shouldn't do string transformations like this
$myLogger->debug("Parsed json object is: {}", [], print_r($jsonObj, true));
```

If you pass over not only simple types (like boolean, int, string, etc) but objects and/or arrays **slf4php** will transform them into strings (when needed only) this way:
   * NULL variable will be "NULL" as string
   * if variable is an array then it will be converted to string with the `print_r()` method
   * if variable is an object then
      * if it has a `__toString()` method then that will be used
      * if not then the object will be converted to string with the `print_r()` method
      
     

Here is another example 


# Recommended usage in your class definitions

When you invoke `LoggerFactory::getLogger(<fully qualified class name>)` what is happening under the hood is that the `LoggerFactory` is going through the configured Loggers and trying to find the best matching one. If you invoke this method 100 times it will be done 100 times! So you should not do that...

In Java the typical usage is this code (probably you can read it)
```java
public class MyClass {
	// get the Logger instance only once / class
	private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyClass.class);
	
	...
	
	public void aMethod() {
		LOG.info("a message...");
	}
}
```
 
Unfortunately we can not do this in PHP because
   * PHP does not support this kind of initialization of a static class variable.. :-(
   * and besides that in PHP static variables might trick you once you do inheritance...
   
The best alternative (I could find so far) is the following:  
In your class definitions
   1. You declare a protected static variable - to hold the reference to the Logger instance
   1. You create a protected static method named e.g. logger() which gets and stores the Logger instance from the `LoggerFactory` - if it is not done before. But **be ware!** You need to reference the protected static variable with the `static::` keyword and _not_ the `self::` keyword! You might need the "late static binding" feature of PHP... 
   1. When you want to log out something you get the Logger instance by invoking the static method (you defined in step 2.)
And when you are extending this class then
   1. Make sure that in the subclass you re-define the protected static variable - using the same name. As you did in step 1.
   
The following code sample shows you this 

Definition of **ClassA**:

```php
<?php

namespace your\namespace;

use swf\slf4php\LoggerFactory;

class ClassA {

	protected static $_LOG;

	/**
	 * @return \swf\slf4php\Logger
	 */
	protected static function logger() {
		if (is_null(static::$_LOG))
			static::$_LOG = LoggerFactory::getLogger(static::class);
		return static::$_LOG;
	}

	public function logSomething() {
		self::logger()->info("a simple message...", []);
	}
}
```

And in definition of subclasses of **ClassA**:

```php
<?php

// this can be on different namespace of course.. but this doesn't matter
namespace different\namespace;

use swf\slf4php\LoggerFactory;
use your\namespace\ClassA;

class ClassASubclass extends ClassA {

	// we need to override this! if we would not do this then we would inherit OR hijack the Logger instance
	// of our superclass...
	protected static $_LOG;

	public function anotherLog() {
		self::logger()->info("another message...", []);
	}
}
```

**Explanation:**  
This will work as expected! `ClassASubclass` inherits the protected static method named `logger()`. But since we are overriding the `protected static $_LOG` field AND the inherited `logger()` method is using "late static binding" the `$_LOG` variable will be initialized the first time the `logger()` method is used in `ClassASubclass`.
