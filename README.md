# What is this project?

**lf4php** is similar to the [slf4j](http://www.slf4j.org/) (The Simple Logging Facade for Java) project.

**lf4php** is not a logging implementation! This is more like an abstraction layer on the top of existing logging frameworks like [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) - just like [slf4j](http://www.slf4j.org/) 

# The concept - in a nut shell

We have the following key entities:

   * **Appenders**  
     You might consider an `Appender` as an output channel. Writes something out to somewhere somehow... (file, database, e-mail, etc.)  
This is the point where an existing logging framework comes to the picture! This project doesn't have own `Appender` implementations. Rather doing that it just gives you "connectors" (typically following the proxy / adapter design patterns) to let you use your favorite logging framework(s).  

   * **Loggers**  
In your code you need a `Logger` instance to log messages. You can invoke the appropriate log method (info(), debug(), warning(), etc.) on it - as defined by the `LoggerInterface` in [PSR/log](https://github.com/php-fig/log)  
Loggers have **log level**. AND... They **have one or more Appenders** behind them! When you log something with your Logger instance this is routed to all the Appenders behind the Logger. So as a result your log message is written to a file, database or sent via e-mail. OR all together!  

   * **LoggerFactory**  
We have a `LoggerFactory`. You ask for the `Logger` instance from the factory - by providing the fully qualified class name of your class you want to do logging from. You get back a `Logger` instance - matching for the logging configuration you have provided to the `LoggerFactory` beforehand.

# And: the configuration

We want to be able to easily configure all the above! To achieve this the best way is having a simple (as possible) **configuration file**.

Take a quick look on the following JSON config and you will immediatelly understand the concept:

```json
{
	"appenders" : [
		{
			"name" : "logFile",
			"builderClass" : "swf\\lf4php\\config\\builder\\monolog\\MonologProxyAppenderBuilder",
			"handlers" : [
				{
					"builderClass" : "swf\\lf4php\\config\\builder\\monolog\\MonologStreamHandlerBuilder",
					"stream" : "${LOG_DIR}/application.log",
					"formatter": {
						"builderClass" : "swf\\lf4php\\config\\builder\\monolog\\MonologLineFormatterBuilder",
						"format" : "[%datetime%] %extra.loggerName%.%level_name%: %message% %context% %extra%\n\n"
					}
				}
			]
		},
		{
			"name" : "console",
			"builderClass" : "swf\\lf4php\\config\\builder\\monolog\\MonologProxyAppenderBuilder",
			"handlers" : [
				{
					"builderClass" : "swf\\lf4php\\config\\builder\\monolog\\MonologStreamHandlerBuilder",
					"stream" : "php://stdout",
					"formatter": {
						"builderClass" : "swf\\lf4php\\config\\builder\\monolog\\MonologLineFormatterBuilder",
						"format" : "[%datetime%] %extra.loggerName%.%level_name%: %message% %context% %extra%\n\n"
					}
				}
			]
		}
	],

	"loggers" : [
		{
			"name" : "your.namespace.A",
			"level" : "DEBUG",
			"appenders" : ["logFile", "console"]
		},
		{
			"name" : "your.namespace.B",
			"level" : "INFO",
			"appenders" : "logFile"
		},
		{
			"level" : "WARNING",
			"appenders" : "logFile"
		}
	]
}
```

With the above simple config we have:
   * Created two Appenders: a log file and a console. Using [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) `StreamHandler`
   * Created a DEBUG level Logger for "your.namespace.A" which is using both the log file Appender and the console Appender
   * Created an INFO level Logger for "your.namespace.B" which is using the log file Appender only
   * And created a WARNING level Logger using the log file Appender too. AND... You can notice that this one has no namespace definition... Which means that this is the *default* logger setup
   
# Basic usage  
  
Assuming you have the above config saved in file named **log.config.json** you can configure the `LoggerFactory` like this:
  
```php
<?php
use swf\lf4php\LoggerFactory;
use swf\lf4php\config\builder\LogConfigBuilder;
use swf\util\JsonUtil;

....

// you might use variables in the json file (unix like style) and we can pass an array to the json parsing mechanism
// to let it resolve the vars
$envVars = [
	'LOG_DIR' => '/var/log'
];
$loggerConfig = LogConfigBuilder::create()->initFromJson(JsonUtil::getJsonObjects("log.config.json"), $envVars)->build();
// and now we can init the factory
LoggerFactory::init($loggerConfig);
```
  
Once you have configured the `LoggerFactory` you can start get `Logger` instances from the factory like this:

```php
$myLogger = LoggerFactory::getLogger(YourClass::class);   // the parameter is the fully qualified class name of YourClass
$myLogger->info("This is a log message", []);
```

As you might have already figured this out when you get a Logger from the factory you will get back the Logger which is matching the configuration!

In this case:
```php
$logger = LoggerFactory::getLogger('\your\namespace\A\MyClass');
```
you will get back a DEBUG level Logger instance with the logFile and the console Appenders behind this.

While in this case:
```php
$logger = LoggerFactory::getLogger('JustAClass');
```
it will be the *default* logger which is matching so you will get back a WARNING level Logger instance with the logFile Appender behind this.

# Recommended usage in your class definitions

When you invoke `LoggerFactory::getLogger(<fully qualified class name>)` what is happening under the hood is that the `LoggerFactory` is going through the configured Loggers and trying to find the best matching one. If you invoke this method 100 times it will be done 100 times! So you should not do that...

In Java the typical usage is this code (probably you can read it)
```java
public class MyClass {
	// get the Logger instance only once / class
	private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyClass.class);
	
	...
	
	public void aMethod() {
		LOG.info("a message...");
	}
}
```
 
Unfortunately we can not do this in PHP because
   * PHP does not support this kind of initialization of a static class variable.. :-(
   * and besides that in PHP static variables might trick you once you do inheritance...
   
The best alternative (I could find so far) is the following:  
In your class definitions
   1. You declare a protected static variable - to hold the reference to the Logger instance
   1. You create a protected static method named e.g. logger() which gets and stores the Logger instance from the `LoggerFactory` - if it is not done before. But **be ware!** You need to reference the protected static variable with the `static::` keyword and _not_ the `self::` keyword! You might need the "late static binding" feature of PHP... 
   1. When you want to log out something you get the Logger instance by invoking the static method (you defined in step 2.)
And when you are extending this class then
   1. Make sure that in the subclass you re-define the protected static variable - using the same name. As you did in step 1.
   
The following code sample shows you this 

Definition of **ClassA**:

```php
<?php

namespace your\namespace;

use swf\lf4php\LoggerFactory;

class ClassA {

	protected static $_LOG;

	/**
	 * @return \swf\lf4php\Logger
	 */
	protected static function logger() {
		if (is_null(static::$_LOG))
			static::$_LOG = LoggerFactory::getLogger(static::class);
		return static::$_LOG;
	}

	public function logSomething() {
		self::logger()->info("a simple message...", []);
	}
}
```

And in definition of subclasses of **ClassA**:

```php
<?php

// note: this is on different namespace as well!
namespace different\namespace;

use swf\lf4php\LoggerFactory;
use your\namespace\ClassA;

class ClassASubclass extends ClassA {

	// we need to override this! if we would not do this then we would inherit OR hijack the Logger instance
	// of our superclass...
	protected static $_LOG;

	public function anotherLog() {
		self::logger()->info("another message...", []);
	}
}
```

This will work as expected! `ClassASubclass` inherits the protected static method named `logger()`. But since it is overriding the `protected static $_LOG` field and the inherited `logger()` method is using late static binding the `$_LOG` variable will be initialized the first time the `logger()` method is used in `ClassASubclass`.


# Features

   * implements psr/log interface
   * we have Loggers and Appenders (output channel) - a Logger can be configured to use multiple Appenders at the same time
   * you can create your own Appenders easily by implementing the interface
   * framework has `MonologProxyAppender` out of the box so you can use [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) as an implementation right now
   * you can configure your Loggers on a namespace (aka package) basis which allows you to use different log levels / output channels (Appenders) at different packages (just like we regularly do in Java!)
   * if you are not configuring up logging then `LoggerFactory` will default to returning 'no operation' Loggers - you can configure logging later anytime
   * builder based architecture - for building up configuration easily
   * all config builder classes support JSON format so you can define your config in JSON files quickly
